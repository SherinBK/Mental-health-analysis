# Mental-health-analysis

In this analysis, we try to find the factors that affect mental health from the data obtained from a survey of around 1400 people from the working population aged between 20 and 70. We also analyze them to put forward a few suggestions that can be implemented in the workplace to build a healthy community. 
The factors considered in this analysis are age, gender, self-employed, ever diagnosed with a mental health issue, family history of illnesses, etc. 

The prediction is done using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest classifier algorithms. The available data is tested and trained and the best model that fits with maximum accuracy is taken for further predictions.
